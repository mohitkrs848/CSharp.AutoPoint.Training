Authentication : Admin/Normal user - Abstraction, Overloading, Enums(different types of users)
Admin: CRUD operations
Normal(if their name is present in database table): Only Create/Read operations


Event Handlers: taking input from the keyboard and performing operations based on the input- like click 1 to Exit.


Exception Handling : try to cover most on the Agent/Implementation part

Loggers : Microsoft.Extensions.Logging to file into Debug folder using timestamp updated on daily basis.

Unit Testing : for the CRUD operations

Async/Await: while calling the Db


Comments: On every implementation method insert a snippet that will have summary, parameters and return type descriptio

Users can access multiple operations: 
- Courses (types/numbers/top elected course)
- Users (total/ types(admin/normal))))
